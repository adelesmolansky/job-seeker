4290944508,Data Science And AI,Kikwetu Foundation,,,Kenya,"Kikwetu Foundation, a Kenyan-based NGO with close to a decade’s worth of grassroots experience working with the youth, has launched the K-Hub (Kikwetu Hub) program whose goal is to train 20,000 young software developers in Nairobi's Eastlands area by 2035.  The program has been motivated by the fact that most initiatives in Kenya that deal with enhancing tech skills are typically located in more affluent areas. As a result, most of the beneficiaries of these programs already come from privileged backgrounds, whether economically or academically. No program currently exists that specifically focuses on Eastlands, meaning that very few young people in the area have the opportunity to gain skills in tech and development. What this means is that a majority of Eastlands youths are being left behind and sidelined in the tech revolution that has been sweeping across not only Kenya but Africa as a whole in recent years. This is despite the fact that poor youth are the ones who require the most support in terms of being equipped with tech skills. K-Hub therefore exists to close this skills gap by leading the revolution in training the often-forgotten Eastlands youth with much-needed tech, programming, and software development skills that will allow them to compete in the digital and e-commerce market, both now and in the future.  The 10-year program shall officially be kick-started in 2025 . The word 'Eastlando’ is Kenyan slang for Eastlands and by using the catchy hashtag #DevsEastlando, we will be able to create considerable momentum and popularity for the initiative, given that youths in Eastlands (our target group) will be able to relate and resonate with it. Therefore, through these hashtags, K-Hub will be able to galvanize support behind the program and create a sustained online movement towards encouraging 20,000 young people in Nairobi to receive training in tech from the program, thereby helping us to achieve the incredible milestone of training 20,000 developers in Eastlands.  It is against this backdrop, therefore, that Kikwetu Foundation, through the K-Hub Incubation Centre, is actively working towards creating a sustainable program to stimulate the development of a vibrant technopreneurial economy where young people in Eastlands will be inspired to venture into the tech field once they see that it is a viable career option. In the process, we shall be contributing towards creating thousands of job opportunities for young Kenyans in Eastlands and Nairobi as a whole.  Tech is undoubtedly the key to future prosperity because the world is increasingly becoming digital, and without software development and programming skills, Eastlands youths stand the real risk of continuing to be economically disenfranchised due to unemployment and the lack of skills necessary to create tech-driven businesses. With this program, therefore, we will be directly facilitating the economic growth of one of Nairobi’s most historically economically disenfranchised areas by allowing thousands of young people to not only secure employment in the tech space but also to create jobs for themselves and other members of the community.

4291217275,Product Manager,M7 Health,,,"New York, NY","About M7 Health  M7 Health is an AI-powered nursing workforce management platform that enables health systems to staff, support, and retain their nursing teams with ease and efficiency. As hospitals grapple with record nurse shortages and rising labor costs, M7 empowers nurse leaders with real-time data, intelligent staffing insights, and predictive tools — enabling more sustainable, flexible, and cost-effective schedules. Our mission is to help health systems build resilient care teams through smarter workforce design, ultimately improving both clinician well-being and patient outcomes.  We’re live in over 80 hospitals, and we recently closed a $10M Series A round, led by Threshold Ventures, with backing from First Round Capital, 25M Health, Lakehouse Ventures, and more.  What You’ll Do At M7  We’re looking for a 1% Product Manager, someone ready to step into a critical role at the center of M7’s growth story. As a Product Manager, you’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution for our core product experience. You’ll work closely with engineering, design, sales, and customer success to define what we build, why it matters, and how it drives value for health system leaders and frontline nurses.  Your Responsibilities Will Include   Define the roadmap: Balance customer needs, business goals, and technical reality to keep us building the right things at the right time. Ship with speed and quality: Work hand-in-hand with design and engineering to scope, prioritize, and deliver features that matter. Measure and learn: Use data ruthlessly to evaluate what’s working (and what’s not), and iterate fast. Champion the user: Make sure every decision reflects the needs of nurse managers and workforce leaders, without losing sight of the bigger picture. Launch with impact: Team up with Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success to bring products to users and drive adoption.   You’ll Thrive In This Role If You   Sweat the details, but don’t get lost in them. Lean on data heavily. You put both qualitative and quantitative data at the center of every product decision. Are obsessed with deeply understanding users’ experiences and motivators — and love reimagining workflows instead of just digitizing them. Are motivated by how emerging Gen AI technologies can actually redesign the day-to-day experience of clinicians in hospitals. Are energized by working cross-functionally. Not just with eng and design, but with customers, sales, and ops. Care deeply about our mission and want your work to matter.   Compensation And Benefits  This role offers industry-competitive compensation, including cash compensation, equity, and healthcare benefits.  Equal Opportunity Employer  At M7 Health, we aim to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and backgrounds leads to a better environment for our people and a better product for our clients. M7 Health is an equal-opportunity employer and encourages all applicants from every background and life experience to apply.
