This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models.\nModel Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models.\nModel Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose.\nMachine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project.

You’ll be expected to help conceive, code, and deploy data science models at scale using the latest industry tools. Important skills include data wrangling, feature engineering, developing models, and testing metrics.\n\nWhat you'll bring\n\n\nModel Prototyping: The ML Engineer would be expected to build prototype models alongside data scientists. This may involve data exploration, high-performance data processing, and machine learning algorithm exploration. The ML engineer will be expected to come up with a rationale for model choice and come up with metrics to properly evaluate models.\nModel Productionalization: Works with data scientists to productionalize prototype models to the point where it can be used by customers at scale. This might involve increasing the amount of data used to train the model, automation of training and prediction, and orchestration of data for continuous prediction. The engineer would be expected to understand the details of the data being used and provide metrics to compare models.\nModel Enhancement: Work on existing codebases to either enhance model prediction performance or to reduce training time. In this use case you will need to understand the specifics of the algorithm implementation in order to enhance it. This enhancement could be exploratory work based off of a performance need or directed work based off of ideas that other data science team members propose.\nMachine Learning Tools: The ML Engineer would build a tool for a specific project, or multiple projects though generally these types of projects are decoupled from any one project. The goal of this type of use case would be to ease a pain point in the data science process. This may involve speeding up training, making a data processing easier, or data management tooling.\n\n\nQualifications\n\n\nBS, MS, or PhD degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent practical experience.\nKnowledgeable with Data Science tools and frameworks (i.e. Python, Scikit, NLTK, Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, R, Spark).\nBasic knowledge of machine learning techniques (i.e. classification, regression, and clustering).\n\n\nHow you will lead\n\n\nDiscover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them “machine learning ready”.\nWork with data scientists to create and refine features from the underlying data and build pipelines to train and deploy models.\nPartner with data scientists to understand, implement, refine and design machine learning and other algorithms.\nRun regular A/B tests, gather data, perform statistical analysis, draw conclusions on the impact of your models.\nWork cross functionally with product managers, data scientists and product engineers, and communicate results to peers and leaders.\nExplore new technology shifts in order to determine how they might connect with the customer benefits we wish to deliver.\n\n\nIntuit provides a competitive compensation package with a strong pay for performance rewards approach. The expected base pay range for this position is: Bay Area California $137,500.00 - 186,500.00Southern California $124,500.00 - 168,500.00New York $136,000.00 - 184,000.00This position will be eligible for a cash bonus, equity rewards and benefits, in accordance with our applicable plans and programs (see more about our compensation and benefits at Intuit®: Careers | Benefits).Pay offered is based on factors such as job-related knowledge, skills, experience, and work location.

    "place": "Kenya",
    "description": "Kikwetu Foundation, a Kenyan-based NGO with close to a decade’s worth of grassroots experience working with the youth, has launched the K-Hub (Kikwetu Hub) program whose goal is to train 20,000 young software developers in Nairobi's Eastlands area by 2035.\n\nThe program has been motivated by the fact that most initiatives in Kenya that deal with enhancing tech skills are typically located in more affluent areas. As a result, most of the beneficiaries of these programs already come from privileged backgrounds, whether economically or academically. No program currently exists that specifically focuses on Eastlands, meaning that very few young people in the area have the opportunity to gain skills in tech and development. What this means is that a majority of Eastlands youths are being left behind and sidelined in the tech revolution that has been sweeping across not only Kenya but Africa as a whole in recent years. This is despite the fact that poor youth are the ones who require the most support in terms of being equipped with tech skills. K-Hub therefore exists to close this skills gap by leading the revolution in training the often-forgotten Eastlands youth with much-needed tech, programming, and software development skills that will allow them to compete in the digital and e-commerce market, both now and in the future.\n\nThe 10-year program shall officially be kick-started in 2025 . The word 'Eastlando’ is Kenyan slang for Eastlands and by using the catchy hashtag #DevsEastlando, we will be able to create considerable momentum and popularity for the initiative, given that youths in Eastlands (our target group) will be able to relate and resonate with it.

As a result, most of the beneficiaries of these programs already come from privileged backgrounds, whether economically or academically. No program currently exists that specifically focuses on Eastlands, meaning that very few young people in the area have the opportunity to gain skills in tech and development. What this means is that a majority of Eastlands youths are being left behind and sidelined in the tech revolution that has been sweeping across not only Kenya but Africa as a whole in recent years. This is despite the fact that poor youth are the ones who require the most support in terms of being equipped with tech skills. K-Hub therefore exists to close this skills gap by leading the revolution in training the often-forgotten Eastlands youth with much-needed tech, programming, and software development skills that will allow them to compete in the digital and e-commerce market, both now and in the future.<br><br>The 10-year program shall officially be kick-started in 2025 . The word 'Eastlando’ is Kenyan slang for Eastlands and by using the catchy hashtag #DevsEastlando, we will be able to create considerable momentum and popularity for the initiative, given that youths in Eastlands (our target group) will be able to relate and resonate with it. Therefore, through these hashtags, K-Hub will be able to galvanize support behind the program and create a sustained online movement towards encouraging 20,000 young people in Nairobi to receive training in tech from the program, thereby helping us to achieve the incredible milestone of training 20,000 developers in Eastlands.<br><br>It is against this backdrop, therefore, that Kikwetu Foundation, through the K-Hub Incubation Centre, is actively working towards creating a sustainable program to stimulate the development of a vibrant technopreneurial economy where young people in Eastlands will be inspired to venture into the tech field once they see that it is a viable career option.

    "description": "About Us\n\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\n\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\n\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).\n\nAbout The Role\n\nNotion is seeking a Finance Data Scientist to join our growing team. In this role, you'll work at the intersection of Finance, Product, and Go-to-Market, using data to drive Notion's growth and success.

    "description": "The Product Management team drives Asana’s product strategy and execution, translating customer needs and opportunities into a compelling roadmap and working cross-functionally to deliver impactful solutions for team productivity and collaboration. We’re helping to define the Work Management category and inventing new ways for teams to work more efficiently together and see the larger purpose behind their work. Our team works directly with Engineering, Design, Experience Research, and Data Science, as well as with Sales, Support, and Marketing to ship great products. You’ll take part in every type of product work here — from strategy to product to process improvements — conceptualizing, launching, and iterating on Asana itself for millions of teams around the world.\n\nWe are looking for an experienced senior product manager to join our team. You’re a product leader who has the basics of PMing down and can take on difficult, ambiguous problems where the strategy and/or solution may not be clear from the outset. You thrive on cross-functional collaboration and are excited to partner with engineering, design, user research, product marketing, product leadership, and the rest of our amazing PM team.\n\nThis role is based in our San Francisco office with an office-centric hybrid schedule. The standard in-office days are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Most Asanas have the option to work from home on Wednesdays. Working from home on Fridays depends on the type of work you do and the teams with which you partner. If you're interviewing for this role, your recruiter will share more about the in-office requirements.\n\nWhat you’ll achieve:\n\n\nDefine and deliver a compelling roadmap that delivers value for enterprise-level customers\nPartner closely with Product Design to create an enterprise software experience that’s intuitive and dead simple\nCreate a product strategy to balance multiple priorities and use cases across customers, product teams, and enterprise-level compliance\nMaximize clarity by bringing a data-driven mindset to setting concrete goals and milestones\nPartner with engineering, design, and other functions to execute on roadmaps with high velocity\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\n5+ years of experience in Product Management. Background in building for complex data models and visualizations, human-centric UX, and B2B platform or enterprise experience preferred.\nSystems thinker: You feel just as comfortable modeling data relationships in a technical diagram, just as well as you can partner with Design to walk stakeholders through a holistic UX flow.\nStrategic: You inspire the company by creating bold, intuitive work connections within the platform and scoping them to solve the most critical customer problems.\nGet Stuff Done: You create, flex, and evangelize a roadmap; thoughtfully break down projects to MVPs and iterative projects to ship with high velocity and business impact.\nCustomer-centric: You analyze our top customer personas; dig into the roots of customer needs; synthesize research to gain a deep understanding and narrow definition of a problem.\nCommunication and collaboration: You partner with cross-functional teammates to deliver high-quality results. You speak with clarity and write sharp product specs. You are highly comfortable getting into deep technical discussions with engineers about the pros and cons of different approaches, and you pair with design on complex user flows.\nGrow Team Asana: You are a mentor for others; create great team morale among other functions and PMs; and share PM best practices you’ve cultivated to date.\nGrowth Mindset: You lead with curiosity and are open to feedback in order to learn.\nDemonstrated curiosity about AI tools and emerging technologies, with a willingness to learn and leverage them to enhance productivity, collaboration, or decision-making.\n\n\nAt Asana, we're committed to building teams that include a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, as this is critical to helping us achieve our mission.

As hospitals grapple with record nurse shortages and rising labor costs, M7 empowers nurse leaders with real-time data, intelligent staffing insights, and predictive tools — enabling more sustainable, flexible, and cost-effective schedules. Our mission is to help health systems build resilient care teams through smarter workforce design, ultimately improving both clinician well-being and patient outcomes.\n\nWe’re live in over 80 hospitals, and we recently closed a $10M Series A round, led by Threshold Ventures, with backing from First Round Capital, 25M Health, Lakehouse Ventures, and more.\n\nWhat You’ll Do At M7\n\nWe’re looking for a 1% Product Manager, someone ready to step into a critical role at the center of M7’s growth story. As a Product Manager, you’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution for our core product experience. You’ll work closely with engineering, design, sales, and customer success to define what we build, why it matters, and how it drives value for health system leaders and frontline nurses.\n\nYour Responsibilities Will Include\n\n\nDefine the roadmap: Balance customer needs, business goals, and technical reality to keep us building the right things at the right time.\nShip with speed and quality: Work hand-in-hand with design and engineering to scope, prioritize, and deliver features that matter.\nMeasure and learn: Use data ruthlessly to evaluate what’s working (and what’s not), and iterate fast.\nChampion the user: Make sure every decision reflects the needs of nurse managers and workforce leaders, without losing sight of the bigger picture.\nLaunch with impact: Team up with Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success to bring products to users and drive adoption.\n\n\nYou’ll Thrive In This Role If You\n\n\nSweat the details, but don’t get lost in them.\nLean on data heavily. You put both qualitative and quantitative data at the center of every product decision.\nAre obsessed with deeply understanding users’ experiences and motivators — and love reimagining workflows instead of just digitizing them.\nAre motivated by how emerging Gen AI technologies can actually redesign the day-to-day experience of clinicians in hospitals.\nAre energized by working cross-functionally. Not just with eng and design, but with customers, sales, and ops.\nCare deeply about our mission and want your work to matter.\n\n\nCompensation And Benefits\n\nThis role offers industry-competitive compensation, including cash compensation, equity, and healthcare benefits.\n\nEqual Opportunity Employer\n\nAt M7 Health, we aim to foster a workplace free from discrimination. We believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and backgrounds leads to a better environment for our people and a better product for our clients.
